### ‚ú® **What You'll Learn**

By following this guide, you will:

- **Set up your Python development environment:** Get Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Python installed and configured.
- **Understand virtual environments:** Learn how to manage project-specific dependencies cleanly.
- **Write your first Python scripts:** Go from "Hello, World!" to basic data operations.
- **Master fundamental programming concepts:** Grasp variables, data types, functions, and Python's unique structure.
- **Work with real data using Pandas:** Learn to read CSV files and manipulate dataframes.
- **Visualize your data with Matplotlib:** Create simple charts and graphs.

### üìö **How to Use This Guide**

This tutorial is divided into section with sequential parts, each building on the knowledge gained in the previous one. **It is highly recommended to read and follow the parts in order.**
### Section 0

This section is a preamble for the rest of the guide. It explains what coding is, why its important, and why we are focusing on using Python as a beginner luanguage. 



### Section 1

- **[Part 1 - Getting Started](Section%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Part%201%20-%20Getting%20Started.md)**: Getting Python and VS Code installed on your system.
- **[Part 2 - Setting Up Your First Python Workspace in VS Code](Section%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Part%202%20-%20Setting%20Up%20Your%20First%20Python%20Workspace%20in%20VS%20Code.md)**: Setting up your project folder and creating an isolated virtual environment.
- **[Part 3 - Your first python scripts - "Hello, Data!"](PSection%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/art%203%20-%20Your%20first%20python%20scripts%20-%20%22Hello,%20Data!%22.md)**: Writing your initial Python code, working with Pandas DataFrames, and creating simple plots with Matplotlib.
- **[Part 4 - Understanding the Basics - How Python Programs Work, pt.1](Section%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Part%204%20-%20Understanding%20the%20Basics%20-%20How%20Python%20Programs%20Work,%20pt.1.md)**: Diving deeper into core programming concepts like how scripts run, variables, data types, and Python's syntax rules.

**All code examples and sample data files mentioned in the tutorial documents can be found in the `Section 1- Getting Started/example_code` folder.** Make sure to reference this folder as you follow along!

### Section 2 - Processing Data

- **[Part 1 - Data and Dataframes](Section%202%20-%20Processing%20Data/Part%201%20-%20Data%20and%20Dataframes.md)**: Getting Python and VS Code installed on your system.
- **[Part 2 - Plotting and Graphing](Section%202%20-%20Processing%20Data/Part%202%20-%20Plotting%20and%20Graphing.md)**:
