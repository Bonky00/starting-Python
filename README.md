# Python for Data Processing: A Beginner's Guide

This repository contains a step-by-step tutorial designed to introduce you to Python programming, with a special focus on practical data processing and visualization techniques. Whether you're completely new to coding or just new to Python, this guide is crafted to walk you through everything from setting up your development environment to writing your first data-crunching scripts.

## **What You'll Learn**

By following this guide, you will:

- **Set up your Python development environment:** Get Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Python installed and configured.
  - [`Section 1, Part 1`](Section%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Part%201%20-%20Getting%20Started.md)
- **Understand virtual environments:** Learn how to manage project-specific dependencies cleanly.
  - [`Section 1, Part 2`](Section%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Part%202%20-%20Setting%20Up%20Your%20First%20Python%20Workspace%20in%20VS%20Code.md)
- **Write your first Python scripts:** Go from "Hello, World!" to basic data operations.
  - [`Section 1, Part 3`](PSection%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/art%203%20-%20Your%20first%20python%20scripts%20-%20%22Hello,%20Data!%22.md)
- **Understand fundamental programming concepts:** Grasp variables, data types, functions, and Python's unique structure.
  - [`Section 1, Part 4`](Section%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Part%204%20-%20Understanding%20the%20Basics%20-%20How%20Python%20Programs%20Work,%20pt.1.md)
- **Work with real data using Pandas:** Learn to read CSV files and manipulate dataframes.
  - [`Section 2, Part 1`](Section%202%20-%20Processing%20Data/Part%201%20-%20Data%20and%20Dataframes.md)
- **Visualize your data with Matplotlib:** Create simple charts and graphs.
  - [`Section 2, Part 2`](Section%202%20-%20Processing%20Data/Part%202%20-%20Plotting%20and%20Graphing.md)
