# Setting Up the Environment
## Step 1: Install Python


1. Open your web browser and go to the **Official Python Website** [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Download the Latest Version:** You'll see a button to download the latest version of Python. Click on it. As of today, the latest stable release is Python 3.12.3.
	- **For Windows:** Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file to start the installer.
	- **Important!** Make sure to check the box that says **"Add python.exe to PATH"** at the very beginning of the installation process. This is crucial for your computer to find Python easily.
	- Then, you can typically just click "Install Now" or "Next" through the rest of the prompts.

3. **Verify the Installation:** Once Python is installed, let's quickly check if it's working correctly.
	- **For Windows:** Open the **Command Prompt** (search for "cmd" in the Start menu).
	- In the Command Prompt or Terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
	```bash
	python --version
	```
	- You should see something like `Python 3.x.x` displayed, confirming that Python is installed. If you get an error, double-check that you checked the "Add python.exe to PATH" option during installation

## Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
VS Code is where you'll write and manage your Python code.
1. **Go to the VS Code Website:** Open your web browser and go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. **Download VS Code:** Click on the download link for your operating system (Windows).
3. **Install VS Code:**
      - **For Windows:** Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation wizard. You can usually accept the default options.
4. **Open VS Code:** Once installed, open Visual Studio Code from your applications or Start menu.

### Step 3: Install the Python Extension for VS Code

VS Code is highly customisable through extensions. To make it great for Python development, we need to install the official Python extension.

1. **Open Extensions View:** In VS Code, look at the left sidebar. You'll see several icons. Click on the **Extensions** icon (it looks like four squares, one of them separated).

2. **Search for Python:** In the search bar at the top of the Extensions view, type `Python`.    
3. **Install the Official Python Extension:** You should see an extension named **"Python"** published by Microsoft. Click the **"Install"** button next to it.    
    - This extension provides features like code completion, debugging, linting, and more, which are incredibly helpful for writing Python code
