2. Add the data into a pandas dataframe for processing
3. Process the compacted data, finding usful information like the average, min and max of each data set
4. Display the information to the user both graphically, and generating a .pdf report of the usful informaiton.

## Creat your Environment

1. Create an new folder for this project on your computer.
1. Follow the instructions from the previous sections to create you virtual invironment ([Section 1, part 2](/Section%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Part%202%20-%20Setting%20Up%20Your%20First%20Python%20Workspace%20in%20VS%20Code.md))

## Collect the data files

Download the three data example files into your working folder for this project. They can be found in in this folder: [Example Data](/Section%203%20-%20Putting%20it%20together/Example_data/)
