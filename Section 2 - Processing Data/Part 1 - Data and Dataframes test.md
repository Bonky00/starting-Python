# Part 1 - Data and Dataframes

A very common way to access and manipulate data is through a python package named `pandas` and creating what is known as a `dataframe`

`dataframes` make manipulation of many different source files realativly easy, allowing for unification of structure and allowing operations to be conduceed on them. This will be demonstrated later in this section. Common files to be parsed into a `dataframe` are (but not limited to by any means):

- text (.txt) - Example:
- csv (.csv)
- excel (.xslx)
